    "Write a for loop to create another dictionary from the above where the marks are replaced by grades. Above 80 is A grade, 60–80 is B grade, 40–60 is C grade, and below 40 is F. Create another dictionary to store the max and average marks for each student. Use this dictionary to compute the final CPI/CGPA of the student. Course1 is of 4 credits, Course2 of 10 credits, and Course3 of 6 credits. Store these credits in a list. Write this dictionary as a json file, and read it back into a new dictionary."
